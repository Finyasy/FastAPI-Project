## Install FastAPI
The first step is to install FastAPI....that also includes uvicorn, so that you can use as the server that runs your code.
This is what you would probably do once you want to deploy your application to production:
> pip install fastapi
Also install uvicorn to work as the server:
> pip install uvicorn
